        - add/finish ECHECK support (google of TCInterfaceGuide indicated
          s/processcheck.asp/processcheckonline.asp/)
        - fix another problem with transactions going through but coming back
          denied: Returned "Auth" field can have trailing whitespace, wtf!
        - trim "<html><body> </body></html>" tags off of return info.  This
          was preventing TransID (B:OP order_number) from being returned.
        - add tests: order_number, check, bad_check
